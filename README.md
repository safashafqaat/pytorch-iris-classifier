# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification with PyTorch & SHAP

This project demonstrates a simple **Neural Network (NN)** built using **PyTorch** to classify the famous **Iris dataset** into 3 flower species:
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

Additionally, the project integrates **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to explain the model predictions and understand **feature importance**.

---

##  Features
- Neural Network implemented from scratch with **PyTorch**
- Trained and tested on the **Iris dataset**
- Visualization of **correct vs wrong predictions**
- **SHAP explainability** for feature contributions
- Clean and modular Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format

---

##  Results
- Model achieved **high accuracy** on the test set  
- SHAP analysis showed **petal length** and **petal width** as the most important features  
- Scatter plots highlight correct (green) vs wrong (red) predictions after PCA
